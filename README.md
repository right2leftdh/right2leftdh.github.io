# Right2Left Digital Humanities
Where do you encounter problems with right-to-left, bi-directional, or top-to-bottom text? Have problems entering Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu, Syriac, or other text with a right-to-left direction on a website or in an app? What about vertical Japanese, Chinese, or Korean?

[Submit an issue!](https://github.com/right2leftdh/right2leftdh.github.io/issues/new) We're here to get your input and examples and, ultimately, to work toward providing ways to get better support for these languages in all kinds of digital tools.

When you submit an issue, **please include** 
 - a screenshot
 - the version of the program/browser and your operating system
 - a short description of what you're trying to do and what is not working
 
## About us
We are an informal group that started at the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute 2019](http://dhsi.org/) to discuss what it's like to work in a right-to-left or multi-directional digital environment, as well as what works and what doesn't. Watch for more upcoming events under the Right2Left banner!
